# Hi, I'm Jonah

I work as a backend developer at [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/) writing Node.js & TypeScript apps for our platform team.

In my free time, I volunteer as a mentor for [FRC Team 581](https://team581.club).

I also do a lot of open source full-stack work which you can view here on my GitHub.
